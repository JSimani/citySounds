## Problem Statement
There should be an easy and interactive way to find songs, artists, and albums relating to specific cities in the United States, and be able to play the selected media within the map.

## Solution
A website that displays a map with markers for each major city in the United States, each containing a list of popular songs, artists, and albums relating to that city. When specific media is selected, the user is redirected to a spotify page for the specific media. Each album and artist has a play button next to it, so that its media can be played within the map.

## Features
* Interactive map
* Geolocation
* Clickable city markers
* Overlay for each city containing related songs, artists, and albums
* Links to spotify page for every song, artist, and album
* Music Player with playback controls for artists and albums

## Data Used and Collected

* Spotify search data for each major city
* User's geolocation
